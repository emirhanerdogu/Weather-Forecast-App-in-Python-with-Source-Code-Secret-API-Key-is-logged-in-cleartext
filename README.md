# Overview

Secret API Key is logged in cleartext Weather Forecast App in Python with Source Code

The explicit inclusion of the API key value in the source code poses significant security risks. Unauthorized access can enable malicious actors to exploit services through the API without incurring charges, potentially leading to the exhaustion of usage quotas and overutilization of server resources, causing billing complications. Moreover, an attacker with access to an API key can compromise data integrity by reading, writing, modifying, or deleting information within the database without proper authorization. This unauthorized access may also facilitate the installation and execution of malware on the server, posing a serious threat. Additionally, API keys can be exploited in phishing attacks, allowing attackers to steal user information through fake websites or malicious software.
